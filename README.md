# Bus-Reservation-System-and-Snack-Ordering-System
This project is a C-based console application that simulates a Bus Reservation System with an additional feature to order snacks for the journey. The system allows users to create accounts, book and cancel tickets, check bus status, order snacks, and access customer support. Admins have the ability to manage buses and snacks.
